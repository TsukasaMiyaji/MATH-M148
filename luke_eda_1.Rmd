Initial Personal Analysis
```{r}

mode_stats <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}

glimpse(export)


# DEFINE COLUMNS IN EXPORT
# journey_steps
unique_seq <- export %>% select(journey_steps_until_end) %>% unique() %>% pull(1)
unique_seq <- sort(unique_seq)
length(unique_seq)
unique_seq[3299]
# it seems the seq is 1-3299 are there missing numbers?
idx <- any((1:3299) != unique_seq)
idx
# no missing numbers. 
# CONCLUSION: min = 1, max = 3299

# try to see pattern after conjoining event_def with export
glimpse(event_def)
event_def %>% filter(str_detect(event_name, "web"))
# each event has an id. in export, event_name and ed_id are correlated.

# gets count of unique ed_id
export_head %>% select(ed_id) %>% ggplot(aes(x = ed_id)) + geom_bar()

# mode of ed_id
export %>% pull(ed_id) %>% mode_stats()

# 19 is most frequent ed_id

# filter

export %>% filter(ed_id == 19)

# there is significance in ed_id,
# also there is significance in the event name and account number
# event name is what the person does on the website
# account number is the user???
